    <string name="title_activity_info">Why Cycle15?</string>

    <string name="info">Studies have shown that cycling is better than walking or running for maintaining muscle and strength, and high intensity intervals are better for fat burning.
        So why not a combine the two? Not only is short duration, high intensity cardio better for strength and hypertrophy, it is also superior for fat loss.
        Scientific research has found that people who perform four to six 30 second sprints lost twice as much body fat as people who performed low intensity cardio for 30-60 minutes.
        This is most likely because high intensity sprinting or cycling causes your muscles to make high velocity contractions, activating fast twitch muscle fibers compared to endurance
        cardio work which most likely will not activate the large fast twitch muscle fibers. Cycle15 is one of the best possible Cardio workouts.
        It combines muscle building and cardio and is more effective than walking on an incline treadmill for over an hour.</string>
